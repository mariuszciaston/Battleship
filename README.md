# Battleship

Battleship game with PvP/CvC modes, speed change and laser sounds. What else you need? :)

CvC mode in full speed with sounds is absolute madness, be sure to check it out!<br>

Features:<br>
• Drag and drop (this one was tough to implement!)<br>
• Right click to rotate ship<br>
• Random placement with reserved space around ships<br>
• Player vs Player mode<br>
• Computer vs Computer mode (this one is fun)<br>
• Turn speed changer (Slow = 1s, Fast = 100ms, Full speed = 0ms)<br>
• 'Bells and whistles' (sounds, animations etc.)<br>
• Responsive design<br>

Known problems:<br>
• Drag and drop doesn't work in Firefox and on mobile (use 'Random placement' button to place ships)

Work in progress!
